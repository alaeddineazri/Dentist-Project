All canals are cleaning ensuring that the entire nerve is removed, and the infection and bacteria has been cleaned out. Medication may be placed depending on the severity of the infection allowing the tooth to fully heal before the final material is placed in the root and the tooth is fully sealed. Depending on the tooth and the amount of natural tooth structure missing a crown or large filling will be needed to ensure an adequate seal to protect the root canal.Antibiotics are sometimes needed if the infection has spread.",
    descriptionTitle2:"Do I Need It?",
    description2: "Root canals address disease and injury to the dental pulp. The pulp is the soft tissue inside the tooth that contains the blood vessels and nerves that innervate the tooth. When the pulp is diseased or damaged it needs attention. This can occur if your tooth becomes cracked or damaged as well as if you have an existing filling that is large or a deep cavity. If you have any pain or sensitivity to hot or cold or discomfort on chewing you may need a root canal."
